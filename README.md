- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiffanys92
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a weird assortment of things. In no particular order, I like tech, animals, makeup, interior design, books, movies, crafts. Just to name a few things :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to plan a wedding during a pandemic while attending school full time. (Advice to everyone - DON'T DO IT). In College, I'm learning all things IT! Including c#, php, javascript, sql and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... honestly, at the moment, I don't even have time to sleep. BUT once I have the free time, I would love to collaborate on anything. I love learning and trying new things.
